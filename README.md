Working memory performance and attention are associated with episodic memory performance

## Abstract: 
[insert abstract text here]

## Introduction

Our memories do not exist in isolation, and neither do the neural circuits that represent them. Experiences may produce transient records in working memory but they can also simultaneously lay down more lasting traces as episodic memories.

Early models proposed that working memory and long-term memory operated wholly in parallel. More recent models propose that they support each other, suggesting these memory systems do not operate entirely independently of one another.

Experiments testing for an interaction between episodic memory and working memory have historically focused on the hypothesis that EM is used to support working memory. Here however, we are interested in investigating if working memory performance and attention has a positive impact on episodic memory performance. We state the hypothesis that better working memory performance and better attention has a positive impact on episodic memory performance.


## Methods

Participants. We analyzed data of N = 1000 subjects from four different samples. Overall, 65% of the subjects were female and the mean age was 22.3 years (range 18 –38). Subjects were recruited from the different areas of Zurich in Switzerland. An overview of the demographics is given in Table 1.

### Study description. 
The experiment took place on 2 consecutive days in lecture halls. On day 1 participants received instructions and were trained on the picture-rating task and a working memory task (N-back). After training, participants performed the picture-rating task. While viewing the pictures, subjects had to rate the perceived valence and arousal of each picture on two three-point scales. The working memory task (10 min) served as a distraction task. It was followed by the unannounced free recall test (no time limit) of the pictures. 

### Statistical analysis. 
Using the statistical analysis program R, we first excluded participants with corrupted data or missing values. To optimize the «signal-to-noise-ratio», we calculated the average over repeated measurements of the working memory and attention tasks. We then calculated a linear model to investigate the effect of working memory performance and attention on episodic memory. To validate our results we calculated further linear models.


## Results
We calculated a linear model to investigate the effect of working memory performance and attention on episodic memory. Significance was found for attention (p-value: 6.71e-07) as well as for working memory (p-value: 3.69e-06).


## Discussion
We have provided evidence that working memory performance  and attention have a specific, measurable influence on the performance of the episodic memory. Why is EM positively influenced by WM performance? It could simply be a side effect, or it could indicate that laboratory tests of working- memory maintenance obscure key features of the way that working memory operates in more naturalistic environments. 


## Conclusion
Half of the time I had no idea what I was doing in R. Therefore, I am not sure if my reported results are even correct. It's now 19:00, I haven't finished the exercise in its entirety, but I'm exhausted.
