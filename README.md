Working memory performance and attention are associated with episodic memory performance

Abstract: 

Introduction
Our memories do not exist in isolation, and neither do the neural circuits that represent them. Experiences may produce transient records in working memory but they can also simultaneously lay down more lasting traces as episodic memories.
Early models proposed that working memory and long-term memory operated wholly in parallel. More recent models propose that they support each other, suggesting these memory systems do not operate entirely independently of one another.
Experiments testing for an interaction between episodic memory and working memory have historically focused on the hypothesis that EM is used to support working memory. Here however, we are interested in investigating if working memory performance and attention has a positive impact on episodic memory performance. We state the hypothesis that better working memory performance and better attention has a positive impact on episodic memory performance.

Methods
Participants. We analyzed data of N = 1000 subjects from four different samples. Overall, 65% of the subjects were female and the mean age was 22.3 years (range 18 â€“38). Subjects were recruited from the different areas of Zurich in Switzerland. An overview of the demographics is given in Table 1.
Study description Sample 1. The experiment took place on 2 consecutive days in lecture halls

Conclusion
Half of the time I had no idea what I was doing in R. Therefore, I am not sure if my reported results are even correct.
